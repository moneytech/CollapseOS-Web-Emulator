; *** TABLES *** DIRECT *** & EXEC ***
;
; THIS SECTION OF THE CODE TESTS A STRING AGAINST A TABLE.
; WHEN A MATCH IS FOUND, CONTROL IS TRANSFERED TO THE SECTION
; OF CODE ACCORDING TO THE TABLE.
;
; AT 'EXEC', DE SHOULD POINT TO THE STRING AND HL SHOULD POINT
; TO THE TABLE-1.  AT 'DIRECT', DE SHOULD POINT TO THE STRING.
; HL WILL BE SET UP TO POINT TO TAB1-1, WHICH IS THE TABLE OF
; ALL DIRECT AND STATEMENT COMMANDS.
;
; A '.' IN THE STRING WILL TERMINATE THE TEST AND THE PARTIAL
; MATCH WILL BE CONSIDERED AS A MATCH.  E.G., 'P.', 'PR.',
; 'PRI.', 'PRIN.', OR 'PRINT' WILL ALL MATCH 'PRINT'.
;
; THE TABLE CONSISTS OF ANY NUMBER OF ITEMS.  EACH ITEM
; IS A STRING OF CHARACTERS WITH BIT 7 SET TO 0 AND
; A JUMP ADDRESS STORED HI-LOW WITH BIT 7 OF THE HIGH
; BYTE SET TO 1.
;
; END OF TABLE IS AN ITEM WITH A JUMP ADDRESS ONLY.  IF THE
; STRING DOES NOT MATCH ANY OF THE OTHER ITEMS, IT WILL
; MATCH THIS NULL ITEM AS DEFAULT.
